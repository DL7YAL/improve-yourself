# Codex

STATUS: partial
TASK: V1 consolidation: supported local launcher and startup validation
BRANCH: `dev/v1-foundation`
CHANGED: Added `tools/dev/Start-V1Review.ps1` as the supported Windows entry point. It validates demo/radar/numeric limits, prepares the locked Python 3.13 environment, runs `iy-workflow`, validates `iy.workflow/v1`, prints the exact review URL and starts `iy-review-server` visibly in the foreground. `-NoServe` supports deterministic artifact smoke tests; `-SkipSetup` is explicit. Setup now verifies every shipped CLI entry point. No browser is silently opened and no system/Optimizer change is performed.
VERIFIED: 28/28 tests pass. Locked setup and dependency consistency pass. Real Mirage `-NoServe` run returned a valid READY_FOR_REVIEW manifest and left no service. Normal launcher mode served `review.html` with HTTP 200 and `iy.review_state/v1` with seven scenes on `127.0.0.1:8877`, then stopped cleanly via Ctrl+C. Git diff check passes.
DECISIONS: Real demos and detailed results remain local and uncommitted. Regression evidence records source SHA-256 and aggregate map/tickrate/count/channel/quality facts, not player names or kill details. Missing `footsteps`/`player_sound` is a disclosed source-capability limitation, not a damaged-demo verdict. Do not commit a real binary fixture unless it is deliberately generated or licensed, non-sensitive, small, and provenance-documented.
OPEN: WAITING_FOR_TRISTAN: Open the generated local `results/replay/732855381761.viewer.html` in a browser and confirm that the six real Mirage scenes place players plausibly on the radar and that their direction lines align with expected sight directions. Windows Computer Use stopped at its browser URL-policy boundary, so Codex did not claim visual validation. Radar redistribution provenance remains unresolved; the binary stays local.
NEXT: Tristan performs the bounded real Mirage sight check when available. Independently, audit the branch against the documented V1-foundation exit condition and close only concrete gaps before preparing review toward `main`; Optimizer mutation/restore remains a separate, later safety boundary requiring explicit design and verification.
COMMIT/PR: Review persistence `e187175`; supported launcher is `659a5e6` on `dev/v1-foundation`.

## 2026-08-17 — Benchmark multi-map transition runtime check

STATUS: blocked
TASK: Implement and validate the locked Nuke -> Ancient -> Inferno transition sequence.
BRANCH: `dev/v1-foundation`
CHANGED: Controller V1.1 adds explicit transition metadata/markers, retains the controlled first Nuke smoke wall, removes the obsolete Ancient-end/Inferno-start smokes, adds the Red Room landmark marker and flash/white-fade handoff, and stages camera turns inside the occlusion windows. README, manifest and transition tests describe and enforce the source contract.
VERIFIED: Source/addon sync was hash-verified with backups before deployment. Automated suite passed 32/32 before the second Full Compile. The second Full Compile produced `game/csgo_addons/improve_yourself_benchmark/maps/improve_yourself_benchmark.vpk` at 2026-08-17 00:27:16. Real normal-viewer observation is FAIL: the white/occluded phase clears to empty sky and later effects render without surrounding geometry; a red-tinted empty view is not accepted as Red Room or Inferno validation.
DIAGNOSIS: A read-only DMX conversion of the versioned VMAP shows authored solids/entities centered near the origin (observed origins roughly -1760 through +1377, plus local mesh extents), while the controller sends Ancient to approximately x=+7850..8580 and Inferno to x=-8676..-7756. The transition timing can hide the teleport but cannot create the missing scene geometry. This explains the floating/isolated effects and empty-sky result.
OPEN: BLOCKED on map authoring, not on Steam/Workshop Tools. The locked product design still requires an actual Ancient B ramp/water/reflection scene, visibly red Red Room, and Inferno Apps/stairs. Do not mark the transition complete and do not continue blind camera-yaw tuning.
NEXT: Author or import project-owned graybox geometry for the two missing environments at deliberate coordinates (or rebase paths only after identifying real existing bounds), then re-run Full Compile and capture both occlusion exits. Preserve the first Nuke smoke wall until that comparison is complete.
COMMIT/PR: Pending an intentional checkpoint commit after final diff/test review; no successful runtime claim.

## 2026-08-17 — Transition graybox authoring and runtime recheck

STATUS: blocked
TASK: Establish real Ancient/Inferno destination geometry and valid camera coordinates, then Full Compile and runtime-test the locked transition sequence.
BRANCH: `dev/v1-foundation`
CHANGED: Added `tools/benchmark/author_transition_graybox.py`, which reproducibly clones project-owned cube meshes into an Ancient-style enclosed ramp/water/Red-Room corridor and an Inferno-style enclosed Apps/stair corridor, assigns unique DMX identifiers, extends the light/reflection probe bounds and refuses duplicate authoring. Re-authored controller paths/effects onto those in-map coordinates, retained the controlled first Nuke smoke wall, and kept the flash handoff. README, manifest and transition tests were updated.
VERIFIED: Manifest deploy completed with hash verification and backup `deploy-20260817-005153`. Final source hashes are VMAP `CA54A61FB837669E7E420CEBDB5E1F96B01C666E0531F35B20EBCDCD8E6CFBA8` and controller `8FD5218807B94BF02AFECFB44280C3A04133392FBDCCDC0488EF9D3D5720C53F`. Automated suite passes 32/32. Full Compile completed and loaded the rebuilt map in CS2. Normal-viewer observation remains FAIL: after load and during the moving camera pass the view continues to show the beige-gray origin test area and its orange/white guide lines; the enclosed Ancient corridor, reflective water, Red Room and Inferno stairs are not visible.
DIAGNOSIS: The earlier invalid +/-8,000-unit path error is removed at source and real destination meshes now exist in the VMAP, but source coordinates alone do not establish their compiled runtime placement. The remaining blocker is now narrowed to a mesh transform/instancing mismatch (or equivalent compile-time placement issue) between authored objects and controller camera coordinates, not Steam/Workshop Tools and not missing source geometry.
OPEN: BLOCKED on runtime placement evidence. Do not claim Ancient/Inferno visual acceptance. Do not add more smoke/fade/yaw tuning or more blind geometry before measuring the compiled mesh locations/transform semantics.
NEXT: Convert and inspect the newly authored object transforms together with their referenced mesh data, then derive one directly observable camera target from the compiled placement. Re-run Full Compile and capture Ancient water/Red Room and Inferno stairs only after that coordinate is proven.
COMMIT/PR: Pending checkpoint commit and push after final diff/test/sync verification.

## 2026-08-17 — Compiled graybox transform correction

STATUS: blocked
TASK: Resolve the measured VMAP/runtime placement mismatch before further transition tuning.
BRANCH: `dev/v1-foundation`
CHANGED: `author_transition_graybox.py` now bakes each requested box dimension into the cloned mesh `position:0` vertices and emits unit object scale. The VMAP was reproducibly regenerated from the pre-graybox baseline; Nuke geometry, controller paths, smoke, flash and timing are unchanged. Manifest hash updated to `9D7BE49FD2FA9F720267E5FD155054F478F64416408AC681EF02B578274276CE`.
VERIFIED: 32/32 tests pass. Deployment was hash-verified with backup `deploy-20260817-011505`. After Reload From Disk, Full Compile reported `22 compiled, 0 failed, 1 skipped, 0m:26s`; end build was 2026-08-17 01:16:48 with 29.098 s total elapsed. A fresh normal-viewer run rendered the first transition smoke inside a closed corridor and subsequent frames inside the baked destination rooms, proving that compiled geometry now exists at the controller coordinates.
DIAGNOSIS: The earlier source transforms were arithmetically plausible but object scale was not a reliable compiled-size mechanism for the cloned flat mesh. Vertex baking fixes that placement/shape failure. Current frames are no longer empty sky, but landmark composition remains incomplete: reflective water, the intended Red Room read and the Inferno stair sequence were not all unambiguously visible in the sampled frames.
OPEN: BLOCKED only on marker-synchronized visual composition/acceptance, not Steam, Workshop Tools, missing geometry or runtime placement. Do not claim the full transition complete yet.
NEXT: Capture Ancient water, Red Room approach/flash and Inferno stair exit against their VConsole markers on this baked build. If a landmark misses the frame, adjust only the corresponding camera keyframe/target, then Full Compile and repeat the complete sequence.
COMMIT/PR: Pending checkpoint commit and push after final diff/test/sync verification.
